# DJMini Launcher
The DJMini launcher is a graphical frontend for MAME, primarily intended for playing games from the Beatmania 5-key arcade game series.

Beatmania is an arcade rhythm game series produced by Konami in 1997, ending in 2002. The gameplay involves hitting 5 keys and scratching a turntable to the beat. As notes fall down the lanes, once they hit the bottom you must hit the key in the corresponding lane.
